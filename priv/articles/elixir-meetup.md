Today was the first [Helsinki-Elixir meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Helsinki-Elixir) for people interested in [Elixir language](http://elixir-lang.org/).

I did a short presentation of [Google Sheets library](https://github.com/GrandCru/GoogleSheets), for polling and loading CSV data from a Google Spreadsheet.
